I created this preset for playing the song Feeling Good. In the middle of the song there is a change of tone and I decided to add the chorus pedal at a high level and a touch of overdrive to give it a different tone. 

A foot switch comes in handy to switch between the two presets mid song. If I'm honest, when recording the video, I wanted to switch back to the other preset before the 4th verse, but I missed, so I changed back later. Sometimes you just have to keep playing and make the most of the situation.
