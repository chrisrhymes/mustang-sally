A cool deep blues tone that packs a punch and has a slight delay and reverb. 

I was originally trying to replicate this excellent [Nashville Blues](https://www.fender.com/tone/presets/nashville-blues-1647584987) tone by Rebecca Lovell from Larkin Poe, but the LT25 doesn't have all of the options of the GTX amps. In the end it took on it's own sound with the 50s Twin amp.
