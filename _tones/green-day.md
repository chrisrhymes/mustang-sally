I was learning how to play American Idiot and Holiday by Greenday and wanted a tone that sounded good when playing power chords. I also use this when playing Hit Me With Your Best Shot by Pat Benatar and Buddy Holly by Weezer. 

I like the resulting sound of this preset, without too much gain, but lots of volume.
