I created this preset for playing the song Feeling Good. The chords are mainly on the 5th and 6th string and I wanted more bass in the amp to emphasize these notes more.

I start playing the song using the neck pickup so it's a bit  more mellow and then change to the bridge pickup after the first chorus to get more punch. 

For the middle part I swapped to Feeling Good 2, before swapping back near the end of the song.
